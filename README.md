# NetWork-Vector-AutoRegressive
This is part of my research code in the graduate student period
And this is a stock market forecast algorithm model about NAR-GARCH
It combines traditional statistical methods(GARCH) with network autoregressive models(https://xueningzhu.github.io/files/GNAR.pdf)

Because the data file is too large, if you are interested, I can provide my training data, please contact me by e-mail: duncky584@gmail.com
